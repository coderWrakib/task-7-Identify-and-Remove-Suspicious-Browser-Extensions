# task-7-Identify-and-Remove-Suspicious-Browser-Extensions

## Objective
The objective of this task is to demonstrate how to identify, review, and remove browser extensions to ensure better security and privacy.  
Since no extensions were initially installed, a safe and temporary extension was added for testing purposes.

## Tools Used
- Google Chrome Browser
- Chrome Web Store

## Procedure
1. **Installed Temporary Extension**  
   - Opened Google Chrome and visited the Chrome Web Store.  
   - Searched for "Google Translate" (official extension by Google).  
   - Clicked **Add to Chrome** → **Add Extension**.  
   - Verified the extension was successfully added.

2. **Reviewed Extension Details**  
   - Opened `chrome://extensions/` in Chrome.  
   - Located **Google Translate** and clicked **Details**.  
   - Checked version, developer info, and permissions requested.

3. **Removed Extension**  
   - Returned to `chrome://extensions/`.  
   - Clicked **Remove** under Google Translate.  
   - Confirmed the removal when prompted.

4. **Verified Removal**  
   - Restarted Chrome.  
   - Checked `chrome://extensions/` to confirm the extension was no longer listed.

## Findings
- The installed extension was from a trusted source (Google LLC) and requested minimal permissions.
- Removal was completed without issues.
- This process can be used to safely identify and remove potentially malicious extensions.

## Risks of Malicious Extensions
- Can track browsing activity without consent.
- May inject unwanted advertisements or malware.
- Could steal sensitive data such as passwords or financial information.
- Some disguise themselves as legitimate tools but perform harmful actions in the background.

## Conclusion
By learning to review and remove browser extensions, users can maintain a safer browsing experience and protect personal data. Regularly checking installed extensions helps reduce the risk of security breaches.
